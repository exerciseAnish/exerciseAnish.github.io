The app we built is a simple web application for a music shop. It consists of multiple pages such as the Home page, New Deals page, and Contact Us page. 

The Home page welcomes users to the music shop and displays a message about saving 50% on the first purchase of items more than $100. It also includes a subscription form where users can enter their email to receive alerts for new deals. 

The New Deals page showcases various musical instruments with their respective names, images, and prices. It provides an interactive and visually appealing display of different instruments, including guitars, drums, pianos, flutes, saxophones, mandolins, chimes, and clarinets. 

The Contact Us page allows users to get in touch with the music shop by filling out a contact form. The form requires users to enter their name, email, subject, and message. Upon submission, a success message is displayed, and the form is reset. Contact information for the music shop, such as phone number, email, and address, is also provided.

The app utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface and functionality. It incorporates responsive design, form validation, and basic navigation elements like a back button.
